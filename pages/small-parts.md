### Cord Stop

![](../assets/projects/smallparts-cordstop0.png)

Single piece 3D printable cord stop, tested to work with 2mm to 4.5mm diameter nylon and polyester circular cord. The force required to release the cord is around 1-2kg depending on the materials used, similar to other mass-produced cord stops. Materials with a low flexural modulus such as PETG, PA, PC, or PP are strongly recommended; PLA, ABS, and fiber filled materials will probably not work.

### Snap-In Zip Tie Mount for 2020 Extrusion

3D printable zip tie mount that snaps into 2020 aluminum extrusion. Sized for standard small zip ties up to 3.5mm wide. Materials with a low flexural modulus such as PETG, PA, PC, or PP are strongly recommended; PLA, ABS, and fiber filled materials will probably not work.
