## Summary

![](../assets/phonestand/01040277.jpg)

Credit card sized, 2mm thick print-in-place folding phone stand. Design based on [this phone stand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3157890). Clearance around parts is increased to 0.4mm to make the design more forgiving and easier to print. Edges are beveled for easier insertion into thin wallets. 

## Printing
Print at 0.2mm or 0.3mm layer height. If you use X/Y size compensation, turn it off for this. I used eSUN PLA+ with maximum cooling. If the pieces fuse together at the first layer, they can easily be cut apart with a knife.
