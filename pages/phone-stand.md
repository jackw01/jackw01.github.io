## Summary

![](../assets/projects/phonestand-00.jpg)

Credit card sized, 2mm thick print-in-place folding phone stand. Design based on [this phone stand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3157890). Clearance around parts is increased to 0.4mm and pivot joints are enlarged to make the design easier to print reliably with less post-processing. Edges are beveled for easier insertion into thin wallets.

## Printing
Print in any material at up to 0.3mm layer height. Do not use X/Y size compensation. I printed the phone stand in the photos in eSUN PLA+.
