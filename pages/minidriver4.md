## Notes
Minidriver 4 is a small (80x33x10mm) 3D printable screwdriver handle for 4mm bits with internal storage for 7 bits. This design isn't as comfortable to use as a traditional round-handled driver, but it allows faster and more convenient access to the screwdriver bits than designs where the bits are stored loosely inside a hollow handle.

Fusion 360 original design file included.

## Printing
Printing should be fairly straightforward. Use supports. I used eSUN black PETG for all parts.

### Required Parts
* 1/4in to 4mm bit adapter similar to [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Wiha-75802-Insert-System-Adaptor/dp/B00XIPRG4M/)
* Up to 7 4mm screwdriver bits
* 2x M3x6mm socket cap screws (for the bit cover - 8mm long screws will also work, but will stick out slightly)
* 1x M3x8mm socket cap screw (for holding the bit adapter in place)
* 3x M3 hex nut
