## Summary

3D printable GoPro compatible mounting accessories for cameras, phones, and more. STL files for all parts can be downloaded with the link above, and original Solidworks CAD files are included for modification. <!--The original Solidworks design files can be found in the [GrabCAD folder for this project](https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/projects/gcnUv4yWleEZdF-MvPbkRW6ztajOTvjOf2FrRhKy1aaAlx#/space/gcRLR5dOVLxat1oCPV2CXJvUbPfd5Zgm9qYSkP6tpdQevQ).--> All parts should be printed with 3 or more perimeters. All mounts are designed to be assembled with M5x20mm screws and M5 hex nuts.
